I only want to work on German Cars, Luxury Cars, &amp; sporty Japanese cars (for Turbocharging). Make a Spider &amp; Database that Tracks ALL prices in Secondary consumer Markets: Facebook Marketplace, Cars.com, Carvana, etc. and subtract prices at "Insurance Auctions" + Calculate the fuel cost to get &amp; repair it = Profitable Investments Opportunities!
